# GazeR-demo
A  short Jupyther Notebook showing how to use my gazeR R package.
Please see it at https://github.com/andy0682/GazeR-demo/blob/main/gazeR_demo.ipynb 

The Jupyther notebooks shows sme visualizations of the clustered data in 2-D and 3-D using Plotly.
Unfortunately, when GitHub renders the notebooks as an image the 3-D plots are not displayed.
I have to fix that soon.
